# ❤️ Heart Stroke Prediction System

A Machine Learning–based system that predicts the risk of heart stroke using patient medical data.  
This project focuses on early detection by analyzing key health parameters and applying ML algorithms.

## 📌 About the Project

Heart stroke is a serious medical condition that requires early diagnosis to reduce fatal risks.  
This system uses Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a person is likely to suffer from a heart stroke based on healthcare attributes such as age, glucose level, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle factors.

The project is developed as an **academic mini project** and is suitable for **resume and portfolio use**.
